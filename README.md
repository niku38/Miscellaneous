# Miscellaneous

## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains a collection of small but essential projects and notebooks focused on **statistical testing**, **data exploration**, and **mini case studies**. It's meant to serve as a reference and practice hub for core data analysis concepts using Python.

## 🧪 Included Topics & Scripts

### 📌 Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- ✅ **Z-Test**: One-sample and two-sample z-tests for means  
- ✅ **T-Test**: One-sample, two-sample (independent), and paired t-tests  
- ✅ **Chi-Square Test**: Test for independence using contingency tables  
- ✅ **ANOVA**: Analysis of variance across multiple groups  
- ✅ **Correlation Tests**: Pearson and Spearman correlation with significance  
- ✅ **Normality Tests**: Shapiro-Wilk, D’Agostino’s K² test, and Q-Q plots
